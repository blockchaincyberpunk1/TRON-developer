Smart Contract Auditing

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to teach students how to audit and review TRON smart contracts for security. By conducting a security audit, students will gain valuable experience in identifying vulnerabilities and proposing optimizations to enhance the contract's security and efficiency.

Instructions:

Task Description:

In this assignment, students will be provided with a TRON smart contract and tasked with performing a comprehensive security audit. They should thoroughly review the contract's code, analyze potential vulnerabilities, and provide a detailed audit report. Additionally, students can propose optimizations to enhance the contract's security and efficiency.

Requirements:

1. Assigned Smart Contract:

Provide students with a TRON smart contract source code for auditing. The contract can be of any type (e.g., token, DApp, utility), but it should contain potential vulnerabilities or areas for improvement.
2. Security Audit:

Instruct students to perform a security audit on the provided smart contract. This audit should focus on identifying and documenting security vulnerabilities, code weaknesses, and potential attack vectors.
3. Audit Report:

Require students to create a detailed audit report that includes the following:
Introduction to the audited smart contract and its purpose.
A summary of the audit findings, including identified vulnerabilities and weaknesses.
Detailed explanations of each identified issue, with code snippets and potential consequences.
Recommendations and proposed code improvements to mitigate vulnerabilities.
Suggestions for enhancing the contract's efficiency and gas optimization, if applicable.
4. Code Repository:

Ask students to create a public code repository (e.g., GitHub) for their audit project. This repository should contain the audited contract code, the audit report, and any proposed code improvements.
5. Presentation or Report:

Have students present their audit findings to the class or submit a written report. The presentation or report should include an overview of the audit process, key findings, and proposed solutions.
Evaluation:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Thoroughness and accuracy of the security audit.
Quality and completeness of the audit report.
Clarity of explanations and code snippets.
Effectiveness of proposed solutions and optimizations.
Presentation skills (for presentations) or report organization and structure (for written reports).
