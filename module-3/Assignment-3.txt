Building a DApp on TRON

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to introduce students to decentralized application (DApp) development on the TRON platform. By creating a simple DApp that interacts with TRON smart contracts, students will gain hands-on experience in building real-world applications on the TRON blockchain.

Instructions:

Task Description:

In this assignment, students will be challenged to design and develop a simple decentralized application (DApp) that interacts with one or more smart contracts deployed on the TRON blockchain. The assignment encompasses both the front-end and back-end components of DApp development.

Requirements:

1. DApp Concept:

Allow students to choose a concept for their DApp. It can be a basic use case or a more creative idea that demonstrates the potential of DApps on TRON.
2. Front-End Development:

Instruct students to design and implement the front-end of their DApp. They should create a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the DApp.
3. Smart Contract Integration:

Students should integrate one or more TRON smart contracts into their DApp. These contracts should serve a purpose within the DApp's functionality.
4. User Interactions:

Define the specific user interactions that the DApp should support. For example, if the DApp is a token-based game, students might implement features like transferring tokens, game mechanics, or rewards.
5. Blockchain Integration:

Ensure that students implement the necessary code to interact with TRON smart contracts through the TRON network. They should call contract functions and handle transactions appropriately.
6. Deployment:

Guide students on deploying their DApp to a TRON testnet for testing and demonstration purposes. Provide instructions on how to obtain and fund test TRX for users to interact with the DApp.
7. Documentation:

Instruct students to create documentation for their DApp. This should include a user guide explaining how to use the DApp and an overview of the smart contracts' functionality.
8. Presentation:

Require students to present their DApp to the class. They should demonstrate how it works, explain its purpose, and highlight any innovative or unique features.
9. Testing and Debugging:

Encourage students to thoroughly test and debug their DApp to ensure it functions as intended. This may involve testing different scenarios and handling edge cases.
10. Peer Evaluation:

Consider implementing a peer evaluation component where students provide feedback and suggestions on each other's DApps.
Evaluation:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Creativity and innovation in the DApp concept.
User-friendly and well-designed front-end interface.
Successful integration and interaction with TRON smart contracts.
Effective implementation of user interactions and functionality.
Accuracy of documentation and user guide.
Quality of the presentation, including clarity and demonstration of the DApp's features.
