Creating TRC-20 Tokens

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to instruct students on how to create fungible tokens on the TRON blockchain using the TRC-20 standard. By completing this assignment, students will gain hands-on experience in token creation and deployment, understanding the fundamental concepts of blockchain-based assets.

Instructions:

Task Description:

In this assignment, students will be tasked with creating a TRC-20 token on the TRON blockchain. They will define the properties of the token, deploy it, and provide documentation explaining the use case and functionalities of their newly created token.

Requirements:

1. Token Concept:

Allow students to choose a concept for their TRC-20 token. It can represent anything from a utility token for a DApp to a token for a specific use case.
2. Token Properties:

Instruct students to define the key properties of their token:
Token Name: The name of the token.
Token Symbol: A unique symbol to represent the token.
Total Supply: The total number of tokens to be created.
Decimal Places: The number of decimal places for the token (commonly 18).
3. Smart Contract Development:

Guide students in writing the TRC-20 smart contract for their token. The smart contract should include functions for transferring tokens, checking balances, and managing allowances.
4. Token Deployment:

Instruct students on how to deploy their TRC-20 token to the TRON blockchain. They should use a testnet for deployment and testing purposes.
5. Documentation:

Require students to create documentation for their TRC-20 token. This documentation should include:
An overview of the token's purpose and use case.
Instructions for interacting with the token smart contract.
A description of the token's properties (name, symbol, etc.).
Any additional features or functionality of the token.
6. Presentation:

Ask students to present their TRC-20 tokens to the class. They should explain the concept, use case, and potential benefits of their token.
7. Testing and Debugging:

Encourage students to thoroughly test and debug their token smart contract to ensure it functions correctly.
8. Peer Evaluation:

Consider implementing a peer evaluation component where students provide feedback and suggestions on each other's token projects.
Evaluation:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Clarity and accuracy of the token's concept and purpose.
Correct implementation of the TRC-20 token smart contract.
Successful deployment to the TRON testnet.
Quality of the documentation and user instructions.
Quality of the presentation, including clarity and demonstration of the token's features.
