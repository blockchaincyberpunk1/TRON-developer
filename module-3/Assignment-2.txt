TRON Smart Contract Deployment

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to guide students in deploying TRON smart contracts to a TRON testnet. By providing step-by-step instructions and requiring students to use TRON development tools, they will gain practical experience in the deployment process.

Instructions:

Task Description:

In this assignment, students will focus on deploying a TRON smart contract to a TRON testnet. They should use TRON-specific development tools such as TronBox or TronWeb for the deployment process. Your task is to provide step-by-step deployment instructions, including necessary configurations and contract addresses.

Requirements:

1. Selection of Smart Contract:

Allow students to choose a TRON smart contract for deployment. It can be one they developed in a previous assignment or a sample contract you provide.
2. Testnet Selection:

Instruct students to select a TRON testnet for deploying their smart contract. Provide guidance on choosing a suitable testnet environment.
3. Deployment Steps:

Provide a detailed step-by-step guide for deploying a TRON smart contract. Include the following aspects:
Setting up the necessary development environment (e.g., TronBox, TronWeb).
Configuring connection settings to the selected TRON testnet.
Compiling the smart contract code.
Deploying the smart contract to the testnet.
Verifying the contract deployment on the blockchain.
Obtaining the contract address and other relevant information.
4. Deployment Instructions:

Instruct students to create a document or presentation that provides clear instructions for each step of the deployment process. They should include screenshots or code snippets where relevant to enhance clarity.
5. Contract Address Verification:

Ensure that students know how to verify that their smart contract has been successfully deployed by checking the contract's address on the TRON testnet explorer.
6. Troubleshooting:

Encourage students to include troubleshooting tips for common deployment issues they might encounter.
7. Submission:

Students should submit their deployment instructions document or presentation.
Evaluation:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Accuracy and completeness of the deployment instructions.
Clarity and organization of the document or presentation.
Successful deployment of the smart contract on the selected TRON testnet.
Ability to verify the contract's address and deployment status.
Inclusion of troubleshooting tips and solutions for potential issues.
