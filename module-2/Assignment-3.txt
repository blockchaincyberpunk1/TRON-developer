TRON Smart Contract Development

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to enable students to create their first smart contracts on the TRON blockchain, reinforcing their understanding of TRON's smart contract development ecosystem.

Instructions:

Task Description:

In this assignment, students will apply their knowledge of TRON's smart contract development ecosystem to create a simple smart contract. They will choose one from a set of provided smart contract scenarios or use cases, then develop and deploy the corresponding smart contract on the TRON testnet.

Requirements:

1. Scenario Selection:

Provide students with a list of simple smart contract scenarios or use cases (e.g., token creation, voting system, basic decentralized application).
Ask each student to choose one scenario that interests them.
2. Smart Contract Development:

Instruct students to develop a smart contract using the TRON ecosystem. They should use TRON's native language or Solidity, depending on the scenario and their preference.
The smart contract should include basic state management and interaction functions relevant to the chosen scenario. For example, if they choose a token creation scenario, the contract should have functions for minting and transferring tokens.
3. Documentation:

Require students to document their smart contract code comprehensively. The documentation should include explanations of the contract's functions, variables, and overall functionality.
Encourage them to use comments and clear naming conventions to enhance code readability.
4. Testnet Deployment:

Instruct students to deploy their smart contracts on the TRON testnet. They should obtain the contract's address after deployment.
5. Contract Interaction:

Encourage students to interact with their deployed smart contract on the testnet to verify its functionality. They should test different contract functions and provide examples of successful interactions.
6. Submission:

Ask students to submit their smart contract code, documentation, and the contract's testnet address.
Evaluation:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Completeness and correctness of the smart contract code.
Quality and clarity of the code documentation.
Successful deployment of the smart contract on the TRON testnet.
Evidence of interaction with the deployed contract to demonstrate its functionality.
Adherence to best practices in smart contract development.
