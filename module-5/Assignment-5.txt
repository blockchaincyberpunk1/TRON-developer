Advanced Smart Contract Development

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to challenge students to create advanced TRON smart contracts with complex business logic and functionality.

Instructions:

Task Description:

In this assignment, students will apply their advanced knowledge of TRON smart contract development to create a sophisticated and feature-rich smart contract. They will choose a specific use case that requires complex logic and implement it on the TRON blockchain.

Requirements:

1. Use Case Selection:

Allow students to select a use case that requires advanced smart contract functionality. Some examples include:
Decentralized Exchange (DEX): Implementing a DEX where users can trade TRON-based tokens.
Lending and Borrowing Platform: Creating a lending platform with borrowing, lending, and interest calculation features.
Governance System: Developing a governance system with voting mechanisms and proposals.
Token Vesting Contract: Implementing a vesting contract with configurable release schedules for tokens.
Other Complex Use Cases: Encourage students to propose other advanced use cases that align with the assignment's objectives.
2. Smart Contract Development:

Instruct students to design and develop the TRON smart contract based on their chosen use case. The contract should incorporate complex business logic and advanced features.
3. Documentation:

Require students to provide comprehensive documentation of their smart contract, including:
Detailed explanation of the contract's purpose and functionality.
Description of the contract's internal logic and how it accomplishes its objectives.
Interaction flows and usage instructions for users.
4. Testing:

Students should thoroughly test their smart contract to ensure that it functions correctly and securely. They should provide evidence of testing, including test cases and results.
5. Gas Optimization:

Emphasize the importance of optimizing gas usage in the smart contract. Students should demonstrate their efforts to minimize gas costs while maintaining functionality.
6. User Interface (Optional):

Optionally, students can create a user interface (UI) or frontend for their smart contract to enhance user interactions and usability. This UI can be a web-based application or any other suitable interface.
7. Presentation:

Organize a presentation session where students showcase their advanced smart contracts, explain their chosen use cases, and highlight the contract's complexity and functionality.
8. Evaluation:

Evaluate the quality and complexity of the smart contract, including its advanced features, gas optimization, security, and documentation.
